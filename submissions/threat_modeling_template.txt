Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
- Spoofing - Client traffic from the Docker client to the Docker daemon or registry could be spoofed, or intercepted by a malicious party and replayed.
- Tampering - Daemon configuration may be tampered with by a compromised client, leading to misconfiguration.
- Information Disclosure - The Docker host file system may be misconfigured, exposing sensitive information and leading to insecure defaults
- Denial of Service - Docker distribution may not properly restrict the amount of content accepted by a user. 
- Elevation of Privilege - Container image permissions may be elevated using the --privilege flag. Image libraries may contain security flaws. This can affect image security.

Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
- Spoofing - Calls to the API server could be spoofed by a malicious caller.
- Tampering - The configuration of etcd may be tampered with by an attacker, modifying vital system-level configurations such as pod specs.
- Repudiation - Unauthorized changes can be made to kubelet.
- Denial of Service - Kubelet can be subject to denial of service. 
- Elevation of Privilege - privilege can be abused by using the privileged flag.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
- 2.14.b Disable Userland Proxy (Scored)
- 2.2.b Ensure the logging level is set to 'info' (Scored)
- 4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Scored)

How will you test the changes?
- The change will be tested in a non-production environment such as a test cluster.
- Cluster-bound incoming traffic is often split at the load balancer or if you are running a service mesh, you can do so via the mesh-like Istio or Envoy.
- In the real world, you can really direct some traffic to a test environment via load balancer configuration or if you are running a service mesh. There are also microservices-minded proxies like Traefik that provide ways to load balance Microservices.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
- The change should be tested in a non-production cluster. Once the change is applied, you should monitor metrics using your observability and monitoring techniques like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Editing the cluster.yaml should be version-controlled with Git so the change can be rolled back. However, as a reboot is required, it's not trivial to do quickly. Hence you should be very careful with testing the change.

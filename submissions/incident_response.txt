2. Executive Summary of what happened: There was detected unexpected CPU activity in Grafana dashboard. Further investigation showed extraneous pods running crypto mining pods called "minergate" and "moneropool".
3. Summary of what was affected: Additional crypto mining pods created additional CPU load that could throttle application cluster and increase maintenance cost.
4. Summary of the impact: Application cluster got security weakness where outside actors could create crypto mining pods and drag down application performance.
5. Summary of the remediation steps: Detected crypto mining pods where deleted by system admin. 
6. Summary of lessons learned: Shortlist people who could run kubectl commands. Implement automatic notification for unknown pods created.
